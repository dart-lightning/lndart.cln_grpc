## Introduction

A dart library which facilitates dart GRPC client for core lightning 

## Why cln_grpc?

cln_grpc library is a GRPC wrapper with a generic interface which facilitates easy interaction with core lightning for dart and flutter. It can be used to direclty access core lightning node and to perform some operations on it such as calling rpc method supported by the GRPC interface.  


## How to Use
### How to connect to core lightning using cln_grpc

To connect to a grpc server we need port of server, host and server credentials

Here in this library the only required parameter is path to certificates for authentification, and also provides some optional parameters such as 

- host("localhost" by default): Where the server is running, this need to match what is declared inside the tls certificate
- port(8001 by default): where the grpc server is running, specified as `grpc-port` in the core lightning option
- authority("localhost" by default)
- channelcredentials: Options controlling TLS security settings on a ClientChannel.


To initiate the client and make a connection with the server we declare client like this:
```dart
var client = GRPCClient(rootPath: "<path_to_certificates>");
```
### How to call a method:
There are several ways to call a method 
1. call getinfo with a parse function
```dart
  var response = await client.getinfo(onDecode: (Map<String, dynamc> json) => json);
  print('Response from server\n$response');
```
2. generic call <T, R> with a parse function

Here we need to serialize the request method in order to encode it from json to map
```dart
class ListTransactionProxy extends Serializable {
  ListtransactionsRequest proxy;

  ListTransactionProxy(this.proxy);

  factory ListTransactionProxy.build() =>
      ListTransactionProxy(ListtransactionsRequest());

  @override
  Map<String, dynamic> toJSON() => proxy.writeToJsonMap();

  @override
  T as<T>() => proxy as T;
}
```
after serializing the request we call the generic "call" method and provide some requires parameters as below
```dart
  var transactionList =
      await client.call<ListTransactionProxy, ListtransactionsResponse>(
          method: "listtransactions", params: ListTransactionProxy.build());
  print("Transactions of node");
  print(transactionList.transactions);
```

3. Direct acces to stub incase a method is not found implemented(skip the library architecture)
```dart
  var forwardsList=await client.stub.listForwards(ListforwardsRequest());
  print("forwards of node");
  print(forwardsList.forwards);
```
### Close client connection:
Shutting down the grpc client connection is really easy calling the close method like this:
```dart
  client.close();
```

## How Contribute

### Build system

You can use the make file to make sure that your code can pass the sanity code check of the CI:

The make file contains the following target:

- `make`: formatting, analyze and compile the code;
- `make fmt`: formatting and analyze the code;
- `make check`: run the unit test (if any)

Read out [Hacking guide](#TODO) to find and learn on how we manage the change request (Pull request) workflow.

### Generation Code

In order to update the code client from the new proto file generated by core lightning, we need to copy the new file in the proton we need to generate some dart files from the protos, and use the following commands to update the dart code:

Requirements:
- Upgrade protobuf version equal or above [release 3.15.](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases/tag/v3.15.0)
- Add `protoc-gen-dart` in your path.
- Or else use this command `protoc --dart_out=grpc:./lib/src/ --plugin=protoc-gen-dart=$HOME/.pub-cache/bin/protoc-gen-dart ./protos/primitives.proto ./protos/node.proto` with plugin flag to generate the `.pb.dart` files.


Here are the steps to generate `.pb.dart` files:
- Be on the root of the project.
- Run this command `make gen` to generate the `.pb.dart` files for both `/primitives.proto` and `/node.proto`.
- Rename `./lib/src/protos` to `./lib/src/generated`.
