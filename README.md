## Introduction

The repository is managed as monorepo, and it contains the following packages:

- clightning_rpc: The RPC wrapper around the core lightning API.
- cln_plugin: A library to write extensible plugin in dart for core lightning.

## How to Use

```dart
import 'package:cln_grpc/cln_grpc.dart';

Future<void> main(List<String> args) async {
  var client = GRPCClient(rootPath: args[0], certClientPath: "/");
  var response = await client.getinfo();
  print('Response from server\n$response');
  client.close();
}
```

## How Contribute

### Build system

You can use the make file to make sure that your code can pass the sanity code check of the CI:

The make file contains the following target:

- `make`: formatting, analyze and compile the code;
- `make fmt`: formatting and analyze the code;
- `make check`: run the unit test (if any)

Read out [Hacking guide](#TODO) to find and learn on how we manage the change request (Pull request) workflow.

### Generation Code

In order to update the code client from the new proto file generated by core lightning, we need to copy the new file in the proton we need to generate some dart files from the protos, and use the following commands to update the dart code:

Requirements:
- Upgrade protobuf version equal or above [release 3.15.](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases/tag/v3.15.0)
- Add `protoc-gen-dart` in your path.
- Or else use this command `protoc --dart_out=grpc:./lib/src/ --plugin=protoc-gen-dart=$HOME/.pub-cache/bin/protoc-gen-dart ./protos/primitives.proto ./protos/node.proto` with plugin flag to generate the `.pb.dart` files.


Here are the steps to generate `.pb.dart` files:
- Be on the root of the project.
- Run this command `make gen` to generate the `.pb.dart` files for both `/primitives.proto` and `/node.proto`.
- Rename `./lib/src/protos` to `./lib/src/generated`.
